# Synchronized Transition Systems : symbolic representation of CCSL specifications 
The main tool to analyze CCSL specifications is [TimeSquare](https://timesquare.inria.fr). This is experimental repository to try symbolic representations and in particular the encoding of *Light-CCSL* into Synchronized Transition Systems.  

## Deploying Light-CCSL into Eclipse
1. Install Eclipse, be sure to use the [Modeling Package](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/2020-09/r/eclipse-modeling-tools)
2. Launch Eclipse and install XText
  - Menu Help/Install New Software...
  - Select all available repositories
  - Use filter to type XText
  - Install all the plugins and restart
3. from the command line, unzip the [lightccsl-feature.zip](dependencies/lightccsl-feature.zip) into the dropins folder of your Eclipse installation directory.
  - Be sure to keep the features and dropins folder (and their content) and remove expanded .xml files
4. Restart Eclipse

## Create a .lc file
1. Launch Eclipse where Light-CCSL has been deployed
2. Create an empty project (Better to generate a Java Project for what follows)
3. Create a file with extension .lc (or you can use the Wizard to create an empty file)
4. Open this .lc file, it should trigger the .lc editor
5. Type Ctrl-space any time you do not know the content

## Using .lc from the console

[lccsl-main.jar](dependencies/jar/lccsl-main.jar) contains a program that can transform a .lc file into an executable .java file. This executable requires the same dependencies as the one generated by Eclipse.

- **Example:** `java -jar lccsl-main.jar file.lc [ output-path ]`

would produce an executable java file in *output-path/lccsl*

- To compile the generated code, try [compile.sh](dependencies/jar/src-gen/compile.sh)
- To run the compiled code, try [run.sh](dependencies/jar/src-gen/run.sh)

## Using the generated code

Every time you edit and save the .lc files, a Java file is generated in the src-gen folder
1. Transform your project into a Java project if not already like that
2. add src-gen as a source folder
3. add the required libraries depending on the features you are using (see [dependencies/jar](dependencies/jar))
4. run the generated .java file to execute. the minimum is to print out again the source specification

## Options
There are lots code generation options available. See Windows/Preferences and select the Light-ccsl tab to see the specific options
